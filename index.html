<center><p> Numbuh Two </p></center>
&nbsp;This is the first Infected Zone in the game. It shows the Basics of platforming aswell as pathways through zones with directional arrows. Numbuh Two is the first speed nano in the game, which he is valuble untill level 12 which is when you unlock vheicals where you would not need to have a speed nano equiped.

Peach Creek Estates does not have any monsters in it, but however it has a ton of fusion matter on the ground that hurts you when you walk over it. Since it is still a low level area, Eddy is recomended if you do take damage from the fusion matter if you have his Heal ability. The cannons there are a good way to get to the Fusion Edwardo Fusion Portal which is on a elevated landscape instead of doing the platforming. Edwardos abilities are sort of mid-teir. He does have a Group Heal ability, but if you have Eddy already with Heal, Eduardo's Drain (Damage Over Time) would be best since it would be your first damage ability,

Polky Oaks Junior High is the same as the Future version. It has the more advanced platforming with spining platforms and moving ones. It also has the introduction to Zip Lines which most Infected Zones do have. You can use the Zip Lines to get to the top of the school roof which would make it easier to get to cirtian areas. Unlike the Future, this one does have monsters (Mean Behemoth). Wilt does not have the best abilities, Jump is his best one. Wilt is good in this area due to pot holes in the gound, and high platforming. Blossom also does not have the best abilities, so the one that i would recament is the Antidote ability, which keeps you from taking damage from walking over fusion matter on the ground.

Mandarks House is one of the zones that have the most upward platforming. Most of the ground has Fusion matter, which Blossom would come in handy. Wilt is also good here due to the amount of platforming you need to do to complete cirtian mission that bring you there. Most of the missions requirements are on top of the house. Dee Dee is your first damage nano in the game. She has a Revive ability aswell. She has 2 diffrent kinds of dmaage abilities. Damage Point and Damage Area. I do recommend Damage area because you will be facing groups of monster aswell as them by themselves.

The infected zone is primarily on the Ship and elevated platforming. The platforming goes alway to the top of the ship using floating wood planks and crates. Wilt is a good choice if you want to get up to the top as fast as you could since the platforms are close to each other. Leach is one of or the most powerfull ability in the game. Dealing Damage and healing yourself at the same time. Numbuh Five is one fo the only 4 nanos that have this ability and is highly recommended to use for the rest of the game.

Same as the Future, you primarily use the same tactics as you did during the future version of this zone. When it comes to the Edd nano, his abilities are better to be used later in the game. Snare isnt a powerfull ability and Treasure Finder isnt good at all. Recall however is his best one. Recall is better later in the game when the Zones get larger and have more platforming.

<center><p>Recomended Nano(s): Eddy (Heal), Wilt (Jump), Dee Dee (Damage), Numbuh Five (Leech)</p></center>
Megas' Last Stand is one of the biggest zones in the game as it primarily takes up the entire area of Goat's Junkyard. 2 parts of it are on high elevated places, the buildings and Megas the robot. There are alot of platforming in the area both vertical and horizantal. Wilt is also prvides a easy wasy to get to the far end of the zone where Megas is by being able to grant you a high enough jump over the wall by the entrance of the zone. The zone is flooded with Monsters which is why Leach and damage would be good in this area. The Megas nano however does not have the best skill set in the game and is one of the weakest nanos. He has 2 sleep powers, which is one of the weakest ones. so his Sneak ability would be best for him.

<center><p>Recomended Nanos: Wilt (Jump), Dee Dee (Damage), Numbuh Five (Leech), Megas (Sneak)</p></center>
The Boneyard is similar to Megas' Last Stand which it is almost the size of the Eternal Meadows area. There are alot of Early platforming and monsters to fight on the way. The Fusion Lairs for Billy and Him are both on very high parts in the center of the area. Using Wilt or the canon in the area is a high recomendation if you want to get to these lairs when you are on the missions for them. The Billy nano has only one good ability which is his Danage (Cone) power.
so if you need a damage nano, you can replace him with Dee Dee if you wish.

The Power Plant is one of the tallist and biggest zones in the game. About 50% of the zone is based on very high platforming (above ground) and the other half being a ton of grouped monsters on the ground. There is a pathway floating in the sky from the radio tower to the power plant chimneyis a good way to get around, if you can make it to the top. If you ahve Edd as a Guide, Billy gives you alot of missions that tell u to go up to that part of the area. This pathway also leads you to the end of the zone to the exit portal to leave the area. as for the Professor Utonium nano, he is by far one of the best mobility nano in the game. He has a group Jump which is good if you are playign with friends, but the power that makes Utonium one of the best is his Rocket Ability. Rocket basicly gives you a double jump that is really helpful for any platforming part of the game.

Charles Darwin has a giant pool of fusion matter in the front area of the zone, in which case you can platform over it or use a Antidote nano to swim across. Once you get to the other side there are only a few monsters there that you dont really need a nano to defeat. Jump and Rocket are best for this zone due to having to mainly be ontop of the school due to the ground being covered in fusion matter (the exit portal is also in a floating platform). The Him nano does have decent abilities, so you can choose either Drain or Heal. My recomendation to get Heal since its more useful.

To get into Dizzy World, you have to enter from the portal that si on top of the tram tracks. Dizzy World has minor platforming and some cannons to use aswell. The fusion portal are on top of the circus tents which you cna use Prof. Utonium or Wilt if you dont wish to use platforming. There isnt really a Set Pathway through the zone but there are 2 diffrent ways to go. The first was is around the Ferris Wheel where there is minor platforming involved, or you can go around the circus tents where there are some monsters (Dynamite Mouse). The Bloo nano is sort of mediocere. where hsi abilitys are not the strongest. For Bloo Id' say get the Stun ability.

The Auditorium's main focus is platforming. there are a ton of platforming that has to be done if you want to get across the area. The platforming in this area is more advanced due to moving platforms that  move back and forth from each other and multiple spinning ones. You can use Utoniums Rocket power if you miss a platform so that you can use the second jump to land on it. There is no nano given in this area.

The Jungle Training Area is the area that you are sent to the least (you only need to go here once or twice). There is mainly fusion matter flooring and a few monsters in the area. There is a small platforming section but it is not needed to use to get across. For the Bubbles Nano, you can get either Jump or Damage. Both of these abilities are good on her.

The Entirety of Leaky Lake is the zone itself. The whole zone is primarily made up high platforming and zip lines. The lake is all compressed of Fusion matter so there is no safe landing if you do fall of from the platforming. The pathway goes around the giant rock in the center of the lake and when you do get to the top, you take the zipline down to get ot the exit portal. The Demongo nano is a interesting one since he is both offense and support. Damage beign offense and Revive being support. If you have not gotten a Revive ability yet, I recomend that you get Demongo's.

The Fissure is one of the only Infected Zones that is underground. There are no monsters in this area so damage nanos are not needed. The area consist of 3 raised levels all 3 being diffrent hights. This is where nore advnaced platforming is preformed with moving platforms, raising platforms, and a lot of siplines. There are also glowing Green Balls that move across some of the platforms that can knock you off them. Any Nano with Jump or Rocket is HIGHLY recomended for this area. Same as Numbuh Five, Fourarms had the Leech ability which is by far one of the most powerfull moves in the game. Fourarms also has a EXP bonus aility which is good if you are in a dead level (no more missions for that said level).

Similar to the Jungle Outpost, you are also rarely sent to this location aswell. The Skate Park consist of platforming and monster battles. It is also one of the smallest Zones in the game.

The Sand Castle is a Unique Infected Zone. It starts out with minor platforming over a moat of fusion matter around the sand castle. The platforms take you to the top of the castle where there is a slide that takes you to a smaller platformign section that leads you to the exit. The Mojo Jojo nano isnt the best one to use. His Drain ability is the only usefull one he has.

The caverns are the tallest Infected Zone in the game. You use High Powered Springs and ziplines to go to the top of the tree that has a zipline on the top that brings you to the exit portal. There are no monsters in this area but if you fall of of the tree while climbing it, you have to start again from the bottom unless you land on a tree branch. Numbuh One has good abilitys. He has Heal like Eddy's, and a Damage like Billy's. He also has a Bonus (extra currency drops) which isnt that important so i recomend getting either Heal or Damage.

The Construction Site is a confusing zone at first glance. The pathways have 2 diffrent ways of traveling. To the left is platforming over a pit that has monsters below. The right has Fusion Matter ground that has diffrent monsters on it. There is a large fence in the middle of the area that is un-jumpable (exept with Rocket) which bassicly makes you go do the platforming to get across. The tall Construction buildings are also confusing to climb. there are some blocades that makes you go in a diffrent direction. Mandark has the same situation as Blossom where his powers arent the most usefull. His best power overall is the Antidote. His Group Jump is good aswell but its only usefull if you are playing with friends or a team.

The Hana-Baba Temble is another unique zone in the game. to get through this zone you ahve to tavel to the top of the temple with minor - mid platforming. This is the only zone that is required to have a Rocket or Jump nano, hence there being a rocket icon on the side of the temple. The Grim nano is one of the best ones in the game.with him having Group Heal, Run and Revive, he is the best nano to have when playing with a group of people.

The Gardens is a medium sized area with low teir platforming. it mainly consists of monsters througout the area so any kind of Damage nano is good here. When it comes to getting around the area nanos like Wilt (Jump) or Megas (Sneak) is also a good pick. There arent too many missions here other than the Mojo Jojo guide missions and the Fusion Edd mission so you rarely will be setting foot in here. Dexter is the second nano that has the Rocket power which is the obvious choice on what to pick from. If you do not pick Dexter's Rocket, Recall is also a good choice because it will be coming into play at this point in the game.

This area is when the nano power, Recall, comes into play. Recall lets u respawn to a checkpoint during your travels on the pathway. Rocket is highly recomended with its high platforming and agility. like most areas there are alot of monsters and fusion matter on the ground but the area is mainly about platforming. Similar to Megas, Swampfire has the same move set as Megas (literally a copy and paste).

Area 51.1 is primaraly high elevation platforming with cannons. The canons are one of the only ways to get to the Fusion Portals (Vilgax and Stickybeard). The monsters in the areas are not in groups so it is easy to kill any of them if they try to get in your way.Vilgax's best ability is his speed ablity, which makes him faster than riding vheicals.

The Canopy is a mixure of Area 51.5 and Leaky Lake. Platforming, cannons, and Infected Water. Nothing much else to say about this area. Both Mandy and Coco arent the "Highest Teir" when it comes to nano strength. Mandy has Recall which is good for that part of the game, but Coco does ot have any good abilities. When you choose one for Coco, I do recomend getting the Group Freedom.

Monkey mountian possesit of Vertial platforming by climing th mountian. Raising platforms and ziplines are the only way to travel across aswell as using a Rocket nano. The Numbuh Three nano is a really good support nano. not as good as Grim, but she is still a decent nano. Her Heal and Revive powers are best for her kit. so any one of them will due. As for Junipher Lee,she is similar move set to Wilt exept for one thing. She has a Leech move, which is her best option from the Jump and Snare

The Firepits is a flat landscape with monsters and infected ground. There is minimal platforming and lots of monsters but not grouped ones. Courage has the 2nd best heal in the game so that one is recommended to pick. However, Ed isnt the best nano. similar to Coco, he has 3 of the not so usefull abilities. If i had to choose one (which you do) choose the monster tracker.

<center><p>Recomended Nanos:(Any)</p></center>
Dark Tree Clearing is the Entire area of the Dark Glade. The pathway is full fo grouped monsters so any nano that does grouped damage is best. There is mild platforming where Rocket is handy for this part. The Mandark Lair is in a deep craitor under the tree and it is difficult to get out of it Using a Rocket nano is the best way to get to the platforms above. The Samurai Jack nano has decent abilities when it comes to his playstyle. His damage or Jump ability would be best choosen for him. Aku on the other hand is not so decent, exept for his damage.

This is the Last area in the game. This area is where you put your skills to the test. With advanced platforming, high monster count, and large amounts of ground fusion matter.
